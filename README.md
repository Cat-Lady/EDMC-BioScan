# BioScan plugin for [EDMC]

<img src="BioScan-DSS.png">

BioScan is a utility for explorers and exobiologists that attempts to determine the possible species (and therefore
value) of biological signals on bodies. It uses data such as the atmosphere, gravity, volcanism, surface temperature,
body type, nearby nebulae, and local star type to make the best guess as to what types of flora will be present.

Once done, it will summarize the possible value ranges for all qualifying genera and species.

After you've mapped a planet with biological signals, it will then pare down the list to the detected genera.
And finally, once you've started to scan each species it will display the final type and value of the sample as well as
indicate the scan progress.

Once fully analysed, the total system value (and possible first footfall value) will be shown at the bottom of the pane.

### Navigation

The top of the pane will track all relevant bodies in the system, including a shorthand for the body type and the number
of signals detected there. This can help you quickly determine a DSS target.

BioScan will track your movements and show just the relevant species data if you are currently located at a body of
interest, to help reduce clutter and scrolling. After you initiate a scan, you will get a display of the required sample
distance and your current minimum distance to a previous sample, which is updated in real time.

It will reset your scan progress if the previous scan wasn't completed and you start a different species. It can also
track scans with the composition scanner and will lock in the final species of the genus without requiring
you to scan biologicals one at a time. In this way you can lock in a species and value while competing the analysis of
another lifeform.

### EDSM Integration

Once per system, you can attempt to fetch any data from EDSM. This is helpful if you log out in the middle of scanning a
system and lose the data from the previous session. Unfortunately, EDSM does not track biological signals, so you will
have to manually look up signals for planets that haven't been mapped yet. The journals do resend the detailed signal
info from previously mapped planets, though you may need to travel to them to trigger it.

So if you were in the middle of scanning samples on a planet, fetching data from EDSM should get you the species list
again. However, your scan progress will be lost so completed species will display as unscanned.

## Requirements
* EDMC version 5 and above

## Installation
* Download the [latest release]
* Extract the `.zip` archive that you downloaded into the EDMC `plugins` folder
  * This is accessible via the plugins tab in the EDMC settings window
* Start or restart EDMC to register the new plugin

## Acknowledgements

Conversion of system coordinates to regions thanks to klightspeed's [EliteDangerousRegionMap].

Species calculations are based on various sources, primarily the 
[Deep Space Network](https://ed-dsn.net/) and the
[Codex NSP and Bio requirements spreadsheet][Bio req spreadsheet].

Nebula locations pulled from the [Catalog of Galactic Nebulae] (thanks marx and contributors)

Procedurally generated nebula reference star coordinates pulled from [EDSM]'s API

## Roadmap

* Refinements to species requirements
* ~~Currently implementing a system to detect the presence of a nebula~~
* ~~Track when near a planet and focus the data view for that planet~~
* ~~Add settings for visibility and display options~~
* ~~Add info about sample distance requirements~~
* ~~Possibly utilize EDSM data to fill in missing data (revisiting a system)~~
* ~~Investigate plausibility of getting species from codex scans (Ship / SRV)~~
